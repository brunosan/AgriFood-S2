      "Project abstract: The objective of the National Agriculture Higher Education Project for India is: ‘to support participating Agricultural Universities and ICAR in providing more relevant and higher quality education to agriculture university students.’ ICAR has prepared this Equity Action Plan (EAP) or Indigenous People’s Policy Framework (IPPF) which addresses issues of gender equality and social inclusion with special attention to the needs of the Scheduled Tribe and the Scheduled Caste students and faculty members fulfilling the requirements of OP 4.10. This EAP/IPPF has been prepared using mostly qualitative research methodologies, including an online survey with the primary stakeholder - students and faculties from various social backgrounds, including ST and SC groups. This will be discussed and finalized with intensive stakeholder interviews and focus groups discussions with male and female students and faculties from various social backgrounds, including ST and SC groups, and poor and disadvantaged communities. Mitigation measures include: improving the learning efficiency, skill-sets of the students, especially those from socially and economically vulnerable groups including ST and SC, (ii) supporting faculty to improve their knowledge levels, pedagogical skills, and sensitivity to gender equality and social inclusion issues in agriculture educational institutions, (iii) encouraging institutions of excellence to organize annual technology innovation forums to enable students from various colleges share experiences and innovations; (iv) promoting mentorship amongst students and teachers (to aid needy students and younger faculty members); and (v) supporting research scholars as a part of Institutional Development Plans.\n",
