Negative impacts include: debris, waste material, drainage, soil erosion, waste dumping, water pollution, traffic, and noise. Mitigation measures include: 1) lead to planning and implementation of measures for soil fertility, soil erosion and waste dumping/utilization of waste for useful purposes; 2) lead to increased planning and implementation of measures for addressing water pollution, causes of pollution and surface and ground water quality, as well as the sources of pollution; 3) prevention of seepage losses and water logging monitoring water availability at the tail end, and top soil restoration using farm yard manure. Prevention of soil loss through bunding waste dumping at designated sites waste utilization for bio-composting; 4) reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through alternate cropping, and monitoring of water quality measurement and reduction in pesticide consumption Assessment of chemical fertilizer consumption; 5) conjunctive use of water top soil restoration green plantation; 6) prevention of water logging waste dumping at designated place; 7) routine medical checkup of field staff and labors, provision of potable drinking water at site, provision of proper sewage and waste disposal system, and sanitation facilities have to be provided at the camp sites, and awareness program on HIV aids and other communicable disease may be provided to the work force; 8) proper ventilation may be provided in labor camps, and adequate precaution must be taken to prevent danger from electrical equipments; and 9) limit hours of operation in populated areas, use of barriers to reduce exposure, all crusher used in construction should confirm to relative dust emission devises, low emission construction equipment, vehicles, and generator sets may be used, and provide sirens in vehicles to avoid any collision with human and animals.\n",
      "Relevant snippet: TX: - Improving agricultural extension services - Crop diversification to combat extreme climatic conditions. - Improvement in drainage. - Reduced salinity/ sodicity. - Promote increased use of Farm Yard Manure. The project interventions might result in increased use of fertilizer and pesticides in the command area. The project however also provides the scope for awareness building and pilot demonstration on appropriate fertilization and pest management practices. In this regard a pest management plan has been prepared for sustainable use of pesticide (see chapter 6 and Annexure 6.1). This management plan will be implemented mostly through the Farmer Water Schools.\n",

      "Project abstract: Ratings for the Emergency Support to Enhance Food Security Project for Benin were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: local committees, involving representatives of farmer organizations and municipalities, are the key to proper management and maintenance of storage facilities, drying areas, and irrigation infrastructure. The resolution of land tenure issues should be a prerequisite for all rural project investments. Input subsidies can be the easiest mechanism for many governments to boost food crop production and mitigate the negative impact of food crises, but experience with Emergency Food Security Program (PUASA) showed that although starting an input subsidy scheme could be a good idea in the short run, it is rarely sustainable in the long term because of state budgetary constraints. The challenge is to implement a sound market based mechanism, e.g. the warrantage system as pursued under the project in order to provide an adequate exit. Recent reforms in Benins procurement administration and system must be implemented effectively by all ministries for projects to be implemented more efficiently.\n",
      "Relevant snippet: TX: Stakeholders invited researchers to address issues related to the quality of fertilizer recommendations and application techniques for the various ecological zones; better recommendations would improve the efficiency of fertilizer use. Similar projects should also consider using organic remedies for soil degradation and fertility loss. 64. No environmental or social issues were reported in relation to the use of fertilizers herbicides or insecticides by project beneficiaries. 4. Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome Rating: Moderate 65. Risks to development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are assessed against economic/financial institutional social and environmental criteria.\n",
