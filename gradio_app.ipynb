Suggested measures included sensitization of the community on livestock disease control and prevention and provision of extension, intensify disease and pest surveillance; rehabilitate through reinstatement and tree planting all sites that are being used for construction activities such as camps, materials site (borrow pits and quarries) sites for storage materials and any paths, tracks that may be established during the construction phase and the water management committee should take charge of ensuring sustainability of this; dust from excavations and earth moving vehicles as well as materials delivery; emissions such as smoke, hydrocarbons and nitrogenous gases among others from machinery exhausts; the stockpiles of earth generated during construction works should be suppressed by spraying water or water-based mixtures. Spraying should also be carried out on unpaved road accesses regularly; all machinery and equipment should be maintained in good working order to ensure minimum emissions including carbon monoxide, oxides of Nitrogen and Sulphur, as well as suspended particulate matter; and drivers of construction vehicles and delivery trucks should be cautioned to drive slowly near the site to avoid creating dusty conditions. The drivers of construction vehicles and delivery trucks must be supervised so that they do not leave vehicles idling and limit their speeds so that dust levels are lowered.\n",
